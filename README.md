Designed with the input of graduate students and a philosphy developed with over 10+ years of coaching graduate students, Quester is here to guide you all the way to end of your research journey.

## Technical Notes
Quester is a fast moving project being developed by a single developer and a collection of experts in various academic and research related fields.
There is alot of refactoring and tests to write as we continue to develop features, but we are making quick progress!
